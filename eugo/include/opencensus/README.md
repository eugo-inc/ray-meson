This is a stripped version of https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto/tree/master
with meson.build files for easier integration with Ray. 
As the project has been archived since October 3, 2023, I find it an easier deal to maintain that as a subtree rather than 
git submodule, as it's highly unlikely to change + over time, it may be fully replaced by some other package.
